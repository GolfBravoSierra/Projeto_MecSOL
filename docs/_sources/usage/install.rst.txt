Installation
============

1) Either use pip to install TrussPy (recommended, **but not yet available!**)

    .. code:: bash

       pip install trusspy
   
2) or download this repo as ZIP-file_, unzip it and add the unzipped location to your PYTHONPATH. On Windows 10:
    * open startmenu
    * search for "environment variable"
    * edit environment variable for this account
    * New... (user variable)
        + variable name: PYTHONPATH
        + variable value: `C:\\Path\\to\\trusspy_package\\`
    * to verify the correct path `C:\\Path\\to\\trusspy_package\\` this directory should contain the following files and folders:
          
      .. code-block:: none
      
         + docs\
         + tests\
           - e101\
           - e102\
           - ...
         + trusspy\
           - core\
           - handlers\
           - model.py
           - ...
         README.rst
         LICENSE
             
    
**Hint:** *Method 2) is a quick option for using the latest version of trusspy without installing it.*
    

🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍ 🤦‍♂️ 🤦 🤦‍♂️ 🤦Not yet familiar with Python but want to have a look at TrussPy in action? Give Python a try, it's not that hard to start with. Install one of the popular scientific Python 3.x distributions 

* Anaconda_ (Windows, Max, Linux) or
* WinPython_ (Windows)

and you're ready to go. Python 3 Tutorials? Google is your friend (also search for NumPy, SciPy, SymPy and Matplotlib - these packages are already included with the above mentioned distributions). Ready to go? Proceed with 1) 😎.
